# Battery Charging & Dual LDO Output Board

This board is designed for efficient **battery charging** and **dual regulated voltage output**.

LOG:
V1.0 - TypeC and battery hub are in the same side with three holes for fixed the board
V2.0 - Change the battery hub to the other side and add a hole for fixing the board more stable
